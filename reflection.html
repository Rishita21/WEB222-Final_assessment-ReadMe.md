In such scenarios, responsive design is proved to be a great alternative and solution to such problems.  </li>
            <li> An approach to webpage creation which is known to be responsive design relies on responsive layouts, flexible images and cascading style sheet media queries. The purpose of this responsive design is to detect the visitor’s screen size and orientation and according to it changes that particular layout. </li>
            <li> Also as the days are passing the usage of mobile phones are inclining in the terms of internet.  And also there are various types of applications which are included in the smartphones and such application always need a good webpage and an interface.  </li>
        </ul>

        <p>---> What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your research? </p>

        <ul>
            <li> Designing a webpage is something that needs presence of mind as well as our creativity about how much good webpage we can create with our designing skills. </li>
            <li> This web apps are divided into user-interface, front-end and the back-end. There are certain types of steps for the preparation of these interfaces.  </li>
            <li> Through my research, I learnt a varied areas in the matter of designing websites such as giving them appropriate background colours and images according to their genre, deciding the font-family and the writing and their size. </li>
            <li> I also got a good hold on codes like validating that includes the alert messages that pops when the user does not enter in the way he is asked for.  </li>
            <li> Linking different pages, including images, including videos and the most important thing that is to design the interface visually and get it on the screen with the help of my skills is the most foremost thing to learn throughout the subject.      </li>

        </ul>
        <p>---> Finally, describe your learning experience in the course. </p>
        <a>
            The learning experience that I acquire during the course is of great value as it offered me the skill to develop a webpage on my own and in my own ways and also I can make choice whatever I like to develop my interface and I can make it attractive in whichever way I think that will look fabulous. It also gave me the proper idea regarding how and in what manner should I start coding the program and also what should I develop to get the proper interface.
